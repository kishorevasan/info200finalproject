# info200finalproject
Final project prototype for my Info 200 class. 

A watch enabled mobile app that wakes up the user in case of swaying while driving the car at high speeds. This project would serve to reduce
those type of road accidents which occur due to self induced reasons and can be prevented. Also, it uses data analytics to advise the user  on 
efficient driving patterns throughout the day.
